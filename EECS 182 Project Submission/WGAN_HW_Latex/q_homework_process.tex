\qns{Homework Process and Study Group} \newline
Citing sources and collaborators are an important part of life, including being a student!We also want to understand what resources you find helpful and how much time homework is taking, so we can change things in the future if possible.

\begin{enumerate}
    \qitem {\textbf{What sources (if any) did you use as you worked through the homework?}}
    
    \qitem{\textbf{If you worked with someone on this homework, who did you work with?}} \newline
    List names and student ID’s. (In case of homework party, you can also just describe the group.)
    \qitem{\textbf{Roughly how many total hours did you work on this homework? Write it down here where you’ll need to remember it for the self-grade form.}}
\end{enumerate}
