The Wasserstein GAN paper delves into the convergence issues with GANs, and describes how the usage of a different metric, Wasserstein Distance, is beneficial for the convergence and robustness of a generator. We designed our homework to explore the concepts in the paper with a mathematical rigor suited for EECS 182 while also guiding students through implementation to gain a better grip on the model.
