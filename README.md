The Wasserstein GAN paper delves into the convergence issues with GANs, and describes how the usage of a different metric, Wasserstein Distance, is beneficial for the convergence and robustness of a generator. We designed our homework to explore the concepts in the paper with a mathematical rigor suited for EECS 182 while also guiding students through implementation to gain a better grip on the model.

We have implemented the coding section of this project using Google Colab. Please navigate to the following link to access the dataset, the blank Colab notebooks, and the solutions: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N0JSBAgoGtbzgxn6p1Z1MlQuZb5Tph9U.
The dataset is in the Colab folder as well called small. For you to run the Colab notebooks without any problems, please make sure to create a shortcut of the project folder to your Google Drive. This will allow us to mount to the Drive and use the dataset. These instructions are also listed in the blank Colab notebooks. Here is how to create a shortcut:
1) Right-click on the entire project folder called “GAN and WGAN Compare and Contrast Coding Question”
2) Select “Add shortcut to Drive”
3) Click the blue “Add Shortcut” button
Now, you can open the blank and solution notebooks and run all the code.
